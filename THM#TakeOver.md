  **Difficulty:** Easy  

## Reconnaissance



```bash
nmap -sV -A -T4 <TARGET_IP>
````

### Open Ports and Services

## Exploring the Website

From the room description, hints suggested the development of a **Support** section and a **Blog**.
I added common subdomains (like `support.futurevera.thm` and `blog.futurevera.thm`) to my `/etc/hosts` file.

Result after visiting:

## SSL Certificate Insights

Before proceeding further, I reviewed the SSL certificate:

## DNS Discovery and Adding to Hosts

After discovering the DNS records, I added them to my local `/etc/hosts` file. Upon visiting the new domain...

**BOOM! Access achieved:**

## ðŸ“š Lessons Learned

* Always explore SSL certificates for potential subdomains.
* Pay attention to small hints in web pages (like "Support" and "Blogs").
* Subdomain enumeration and manual DNS mapping are critical skills in reconnaissance.
* Expired certificates and misconfigured DNS entries can lead to critical findings.
